## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
Evaluate the accuracy of of a data model for predicting credit worthiness.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial information included loan size, interest rate, the borrowers income, borrowers debt to income ration, borrowers number of accounts, borrowers derogarory marks, borrowers total debt, and the status of the loan (paid or unpaid). We needed to predict the borrowers credit worthiness based on this data, as well as the likelihood to pay it back based on healthy vs high risk labelling.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
* Balanced Accuracy Score: 95% 
* Precision Score: 92% 
* Recall Score: 95% 


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
* Balanced Accuracy Score: 99% 
* Precision Score: 99% 
* Recall Score: 99% 

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
Machine learning model 2 perfoemed best. 99% accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
Yes.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.

I recommend machine learning model 2
